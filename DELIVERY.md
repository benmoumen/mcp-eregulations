   - Configurable settings for different eRegulations instances
   - Comprehensive tool registry

2. **eRegulations API Integration**
   - API client for accessing eRegulations endpoints
   - Detailed client for comprehensive procedure information
   - Formatters for converting API responses to human-readable text

3. **Data Processing & Indexing**
   - Indexing system for efficient data retrieval
   - Search functionality using keywords
   - Caching for improved performance

4. **Query Handling & Response Generation**
   - Natural language query processing
   - Pattern matching for identifying query types
   - Comprehensive response generation

5. **Authentication & Security**
   - User registration and authentication
   - API key management
   - Role-based access control

6. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Caching with TTL
   - Rate limiting
   - Connection pooling
   - Performance monitoring

7. **Containerization & Deployment**
   - Docker and docker-compose configuration
   - Kubernetes deployment options
   - Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

8. **CI/CD Pipeline**

## Pushing to GitHub

The repository has been initialized and configured with the remote URL `git@github.com:benmoumen/mcp-eregulations.git`. To push the code to GitHub:

1. Ensure you have SSH access to GitHub configured
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

If you prefer to use HTTPS instead of SSH:
1. Change the remote URL:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/benmoumen/mcp-eregulations.git
   ```
2. Push the code:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Next Steps

After pushing to GitHub, you may want to:

1. Enable GitHub Actions in the repository settings
2. Set up branch protection rules for the main branch
3. Configure Dependabot for security updates
4. Set up GitHub Pages for documentation
5. Add collaborators to the repository

## Conclusion

The MCP eRegulations Server is now ready for production use. It provides a robust, scalable, and secure interface for LLMs to access eRegulations data and answer user questions about administrative procedures. The server is configurable to work with different eRegulations instances and can be easily deployed using Docker or Kubernetes.
