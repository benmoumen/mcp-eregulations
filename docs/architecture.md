# MCP eRegulations Server Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that will integrate with the eRegulations platform. The server will enable LLMs to answer user questions about documented administrative procedures by providing structured access to the eRegulations API.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Components

1. **MCP Server Core**
   - Built using Python FastMCP SDK
   - Exposes tools for querying eRegulations data
   - Handles request/response formatting

2. **eRegulations API Integration Layer**
   - Manages connections to eRegulations API
   - Handles authentication and error handling
   - Caches responses for performance

3. **Data Processing & Indexing**
   - Transforms API responses into LLM-friendly formats
   - Indexes procedure data for efficient retrieval
   - Implements search functionality

4. **Query Handling & Response Generation**
   - Interprets user queries
   - Maps queries to appropriate API endpoints
   - Formats responses for LLM consumption

5. **Configuration & Management**
   - Manages server configuration
   - Handles instance-specific settings
   - Provides monitoring and logging

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **MCP Framework**: Python MCP SDK 1.2.0+
- **HTTP Client**: httpx (async)
- **Caching**: Redis (optional for production)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Tool Design

The MCP server will expose the following tools to LLMs:

1. **get_procedure**
   - Retrieves detailed information about a specific procedure
   - Parameters: procedure_id (integer)
   - Returns: Formatted procedure details

2. **search_procedures**
   - Searches for procedures based on keywords or criteria
   - Parameters: query (string), limit (integer, optional)
   - Returns: List of matching procedures with summaries

3. **get_procedure_steps**
   - Retrieves the steps involved in a procedure
   - Parameters: procedure_id (integer)
   - Returns: Ordered list of steps with details

4. **get_procedure_requirements**
   - Retrieves the requirements for a procedure
   - Parameters: procedure_id (integer)
   - Returns: List of requirements with details

5. **get_procedure_costs**
   - Retrieves the costs associated with a procedure
   - Parameters: procedure_id (integer)
   - Returns: Breakdown of costs

6. **get_procedure_timeline**
   - Retrieves the timeline for completing a procedure
   - Parameters: procedure_id (integer)
   - Returns: Timeline information with duration estimates

7. **get_institution_info**
   - Retrieves information about institutions involved in procedures
   - Parameters: institution_id (integer)
   - Returns: Institution details

## Data Flow

1. **User Query Flow**:
   - User asks question to LLM
   - LLM determines relevant tool(s) to use
   - LLM calls tool(s) via MCP client
   - MCP server executes tool function
   - Response is returned to LLM
   - LLM formulates natural language answer

2. **API Integration Flow**:
   - Tool function is called with parameters
   - Parameters are validated
   - Request is sent to eRegulations API
   - Response is received and validated
   - Data is processed and formatted
   - Formatted response is returned to tool function

3. **Error Handling Flow**:
   - Errors are caught at appropriate levels
   - Informative error messages are generated
   - Fallback strategies are implemented where possible
   - Errors are logged for monitoring

## Configuration System

The server will support configuration through:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - `EREGULATIONS_API_URL`: Base URL for the eRegulations API
   - `EREGULATIONS_API_KEY`: API key for authentication (if required)
   - `MCP_SERVER_PORT`: Port for the MCP server
   - `CACHE_ENABLED`: Enable/disable caching
   - `CACHE_TTL`: Time-to-live for cached responses
   - `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging level

2. **Configuration File**:
   - JSON or YAML format
   - Supports all environment variable settings
   - Additional advanced configuration options

## Performance Considerations

1. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache API responses to reduce latency
   - Implement TTL-based cache invalidation
   - Consider Redis for distributed deployments

2. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Use async/await for non-blocking I/O
   - Implement connection pooling for API requests
   - Batch related requests where possible

3. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Limit response payload size
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Use compression for network transfers

## Security Considerations

1. **API Authentication**:
   - Secure storage of API credentials
   - Support for different authentication methods
   - Credential rotation strategy

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize parameters before API calls
   - Implement rate limiting

3. **Output Sanitization**:
   - Remove sensitive information from responses
   - Validate response structure
   - Handle unexpected response formats

## Deployment Architecture

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Local development with direct API access
   - Mock API responses for testing
   - Hot reloading for rapid development

2. **Production Environment**:
   - Containerized deployment with Docker
   - Horizontal scaling capabilities
   - Health monitoring and logging

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Automated testing
   - Continuous integration with GitHub Actions
   - Automated deployment to production
